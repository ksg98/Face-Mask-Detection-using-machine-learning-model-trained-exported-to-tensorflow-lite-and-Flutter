# facemask_detection

COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel coronavirus is continuously spreading until now all over the world. 
The impact of COVID-19 has been fallen on almost all sectors of development. The healthcare system is 
going through a crisis. Many precautionary measures have been taken to reduce the spread of this 
disease where wearing a mask is one of them. In this paper, we propose a system that restrict the 
growth of COVID-19 by finding out people who are not wearing any facial mask in a smart city network 
where all the public places are monitored with Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. While a 
person without a mask is detected, the corresponding authority is informed through the city network.
 A deep learning architecture is trained on a dataset that consists of images of people with and 
without masks collected from various sources. The trained architecture achieved 98.7% accuracy on 
distinguishing people with and without a facial mask for previously unseen test data. It is hoped 
that our study would be a useful tool to reduce the spread of this communicable disease for many 
countries in the world.


We have propsed and Trained a machine learning model which detect the facemask of a person whether the person is
 wearing a facemask or not. We can either integrate to rasberry pi or arduino in oder to integrtate with cctv. There must be
an intelligence work on the people identity and face mask detection. if person is not wearing mask , the model 
will detect the person with and without camera using realtime camera frame 

We have used Ml learning model trained and exported to tensorflow lite file , and intgrate to flutter , it can be exports as
various model
